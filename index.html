        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li> Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is one of the three cornerstone languages used in web development: HTML, CSS, and JS. HTML is used to create the structure of a webpage. It is made up of elements which work together to provide content and the basic framework for all pages on the web.</li>
          <li> The head element contains information, or metadata, that helps the browser to render the page correctly. Elements included within the head are not visible when a user looks at a webpage.</li>
          <li> The body element contains the content that is shown to the user. All the elements that we want the user to see and interact with must be placed inside this element.</li>
          <li> The !doctype declaration tells the browser what document type it should expect when it is opened. </li>
          <li> The title element defines the title for a webpage. This element is required and is extremely important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO).</li>
          <li> The style element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
          <li> The base element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
          <li> The link element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
          <li> The meta element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>
          <li> The script element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>
          <li> The charset element sets our character encoding.</li>
          <li> The http-equiv element sets an HTTP header for content.</li>
          <li> The viewport element sets the default view for our webpage.</li>
          <li> Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements. The element that holds all the children is known as the parent element.</li>
          <li> The h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6 elements represent the level of heading a given text block represents. h1 being the largest.</li>
          <li> The p element represents a paragraph or block of text.</li>
          <li> The ul, ol, and li elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items.</li>
          <li> The img element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage. The img element can contain various attributes; the src attribute is the most important because it defines the location of the image.</li>
          <li> The br element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content.</li>
          <li> The a element (which stands for anchor) creates links to the same webpage or other webpages. The href attribute points to the URL for the link.</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li> There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li> A margin property indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li> The padding property adds space around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li> Two or more elememts with the same styling can be combined in the same CSS rule with a comma.</li>
          <li> The display property is assigned with the block value, which assigns each image to start on a new line.</li>
          <li> CSS files must be linked to HTML files for them to be visible to the user, and so the HTML file recognizes that the other exists.</li>
          <li> The period preceding card designates this as a class selector. Any HTML element assigned to the class, card, will gain these property assignments from the CSS.</li>
